    /// [`Scene::insert_primitive`] appends to the per-kind arrays and is the

    /// a group is closure-scoped. Everything painted inside a group therefore
    /// occupies a contiguous range of every per-kind array *before* any
    /// sorting, and a group can be recorded as eight ranges - a [`Segment`] -
    /// instead of as a scene of its own. All this method does is close the run
    /// in progress and open a new one.
    ///
    /// # Why sorting each run separately is not less correct than sorting once
    ///
    /// [`Scene::finish`] sorts each run's sub-slice rather than the whole
    /// array, so two primitives in different runs are drawn in paint order,
    /// whatever their `order`. That is never worse than the global sort:
    /// `BoundsTree::insert` returns one more than the greatest order among
    /// the bounds a primitive intersects, so a later-painted primitive can only
    /// carry a *lower* order than an earlier one if the tree has established
    /// they are disjoint - and reordering disjoint primitives changes no
    /// pixel. Where two primitives do intersect, the tree's order and paint
    /// order agree, so both schemes draw them the same way round. Segment
    /// ordering is equal-or-more-correct, never less.

    /// # Layers
    ///
    /// A group may sit inside a [`Scene::push_layer`] and a layer may sit
    /// inside a group, but neither may straddle the other, and

    /// inserted into the bounds tree at all - they all take the layer's own
    /// order - so a layer's contents are kept in paint order by the stable
    /// sort alone, and a boundary that cut a layer in half would be splitting
